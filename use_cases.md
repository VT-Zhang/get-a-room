## Use Cases

## Use Case 1: Alex Books a Hotel (Happy-Path)

Alex wants to reserve a hotel room for an upcoming trip. She logs into get-a-room and is forwarded to the main interface. She wants to book a new trip, so she selects the Search Hotels option. She enters her search criteria and is presented with a handful of recommended results. After considering the results, she selects her preferred hotel and is directed to the payment screen. Alex enters her payment information and submits it for processing. Get-a-room displays the confirmation details of her reservation and Alex exits the program.

## Use Case 2: Alex Cancels Her Trip (Cancel-Trip-And-Get-Refund)

Alex needs to cancel her trip so she opens get-a-room and is directed to the main interface. She selects the Itinerary Management option. She sees the trip that she needs to cancel and selects it. She navigates to the Cancel Reservation button and selects it. Upon cancellation, she is presented with a screen that states the reservation has been successfully cancelled and that her refund will be processed.
