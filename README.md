# Online Hotel Booking System: get-a-room

* This repo serves as the collabration tool for our Project 1.
* You can download the design source files from the `master` branch and update the design and flow where needed.
* Please use `Issues` to upload and save images if needed. I found this way is much easier to create a image link within Github.  
* You can go to the `gh-pages` branch and view and edit markdown files. Each markdown file is a section of topic, i.e. requirements, modules, etc.
* Upon finished editing your update for content, you may initiate a pull request. I will merge your PR once reviewed.
