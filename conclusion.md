## Conclusion

There are a number of existing hotel booking websites which utilize a client-server architecture. In this respect, we did not deviate from that tried-and-true architectural style. However, the stand out feature of get-a-room is the machine learning recommendation system which provides personalized search results based on a user's previous hotel room preferences. The machine learning engine is built using a neural network model that is constantly learning and getting better at delivering personalized results. Other key functions of the design include the payment and booking services, which interface with multiple financial institutions and hotel APIs, and an all-in-cloud database solution. By making use of a cloud service, we are able to keep costs lower while achieving a highly scalable, available, and secure system. Our design's combination of a proven architectural strategy, an innovative recommendation engine, and cloud service solution should make get-a-room a reliable travel booking site that is able to differentiate itself in an already established space.
